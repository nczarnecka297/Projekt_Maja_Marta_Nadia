# Sign Language Translator

## Overview
This Sign Language Translator is an innovative tool designed to break down communication barriers by translating sign language into text in real-time. Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, this application offers an accessible and user-friendly interface for translating videos of sign language gestures into understandable text.

## Features
- *Data Version Control (DVC)*: Easily manage and version large data files, facilitating collaboration and streamlining the data pipeline.
- *Customizable Model Building*: Construct and train models with model/preprocessing.py to enhance translation accuracy.
- *Real-Time Translation*: Load sign language videos through asl_video_translator_gui.py and receive instant text translations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- DVC
- Necessary Python libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt

### Data Management with DVC
To get started with DVC, follow these steps:
1. Install DVC using the instructions on the [official DVC documentation](https://dvc.org/doc/install).
2. Pull the data using the DVC command: dvc pull

### Model Setup and Training
To build and train the model, run the following script:
```bash
python model/preprocessing.py

This script preprocesses the input data and trains the model for translation. The output model will be stored in the model/ directory.
Running the Translator

Once the model is trained, you can start translating sign language videos to text with the following command:

bash

python asl_video_translator_gui.py

This will launch a GUI where you can load your sign language video files. The translation output will be displayed in real-time within the GUI. Thank you for your interest in our Sign Language Translator. Together, we can make the world more inclusive for the sign language community.


Please note that you should adjust the paths, commands, and details according to your project's actual configuration and file structure. The above is just a template and may need to be modified to fit your specific implementation.
